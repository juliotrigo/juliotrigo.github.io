Here you can find all the information about the talk that I gave at [PyConES 2019](https://2019.es.pycon.org) on the 5th of October, 2019: ***A practical DDD approach to Nameko microservices***

Here's the excerpt of the talk:

***Nameko** is a “microservices framework for Python that lets service developers concentrate on application logic and encourages testability.”. It's easy to use, has an elegant design and an open source community and ecosystem behind it. In this talk, we will show the basics of how to write microservices using Nameko and the types of extensions and communication protocols that are available.*

*We will also show **a practical domain-driven design (DDD) approach to building a microservices architecture**, showing how the design of the solution is driven by the domain of the application, the different types of services that we create (application/facades, domain), what their responsibilities are and how they can communicate with each other.*

*Finally, we will discuss one of the most important things in software design: how/when to **split our code into different components** (services, dependencies, modules, functions, etc.) so that they serve a single purpose, are easy to understand/extend and “fit in your head”.*
